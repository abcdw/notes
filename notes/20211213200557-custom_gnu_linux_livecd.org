#+title: Custom GNU/Linux LiveCD

* Introduction
Keyboard layout, specific packages, files and services.
- Obtaining tools and generating image.
- Exploring customization possibilities.
- Practice with rde.
* Guix
- Declarative.
- Reproducible.
- Simple.
- Available.

On debian and derivatives:
#+begin_src shell
sudo apt install guix
guix pull
#+end_src

* Generating an ISO Image
As simple as
#+begin_src shell
guix system image -t iso9660 -e '(@ (gnu system install) installation-os)'
#+end_src

If you have a local copy of Guix sources.
#+begin_src shell
cd ~/work/gnu/guix
guix system build gnu/system/install.scm
guix system image -t iso9660 gnu/system/install.scm
#+end_src

* Testing It
Make sure the user is in kvm group. ~C-M-g~ to grab/ungrab input devices.

#+begin_src shell
qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -boot d -m 4096 -cdrom image.iso
#+end_src
* Exploring Internals
* Customizing the Image
** Custom channels
** Building image with rde
* Future Work
- Implement guix-home-service-type.
- Provide pre-configured images.
* Conclusion
- The right way is much easier in long run.
