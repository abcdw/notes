#+title: sway: Workflow and Configuration

* Introduction
- My window management WF.
- About Sway, why and what it covers.
- How it configured.

* Workflow
- Focus on one thing.
- Sometimes secondary apps can be useful.
- Multi-monitor setup is overrated.

External WM is not that integrated: dired patches example.

Usual project workflow:
- magit-diff/magit-status
* IRC chat, matrix bridge
- #tropin and #rde at libera.chat
- https://libera.chat/guides/faq#can-i-connect-with-matrix
  
* About Sway and Why Sway?
- Lightweight.
- Cleaner architecture design.
- Less glitchy.

* Configuration
* Conclusion
- It would be cool to have an integrated DE.
- We can mimic a fraction of its power.
