#+title: How to Live without Internet?
#+filetags: :Stream:

* Introduction
- Story behind GNU Guix mirror.
- Proxies, VPNs and usual ways to bypass blockages.
- Theoretical knowledge on Networking, VPN, IPv4, IPv6, NAT, DNS.
- More advanced technical solution.

* The Story
- Centralization and routing hierarchy.
- Reasons.
- Internet Blackouts.
  
* Networking
** Proxies
squid, privoxy, tinyproxy, nginx, shadowsocks, ssh tunnel.

https://guix.gnu.org/, https://141.80.181.40/

Reverse proxy:
http://guix.trop.in, http://ci.guix.trop.in, http://issues.guix.trop.in
http://167.172.37.172/, [[http://\[204:cbf:3e07:e67a:424f:93bc:fc5c:b3dc\]/][http://[204:cbf:3e07:e67a:424f:93bc:fc5c:b3dc]/]]

One of the easiest ways to change exit location is a forward proxy.

#+begin_src shell
ssh -fND 8123 USER@IP_OR_HOST
#+end_src

The connection is unstable*.

** Domain, DNS, IP address and subnet
*** Domain
[[https://fsf.org][fsf.org]]

*** IPv4
$2^{32} = 4294967296$

*** IPv6
$2^{128} \approx 3.4 \times 10^{38}$

$6.5 \times 10^{23}$ per square meter of the Earth.

** LAN, NAT, Gateway
Local Area Network.

Network Address Translation.

** What's cool about ygg?
- Zeroconfig.
- Flexible routing, which makes a connection blocking-prone.
- Stable white IP, which can migrate to different physical location.
- E2E encrypted.
- Decentralized.
- Fast.

* I2P
In case you are very shy and don't want to ask a question about a
feature in your favorite programming language in a public chat.

- Almost impossible to track traffic flow.
- Very much encrypted.
- Decentralized.
- Slow.

* Conclusion
- Use and create technologies that respect your freedom and do not
require trust.
