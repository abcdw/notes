- Download.  Fetching the package from ELPA.
- Install.  Untar the package, or write the .el file, into
  ~/.emacs.d/elpa/ directory.
- Autoload generation.
- Byte compile.  Currently this phase is done during install,
  but we may change this.
- Activate.  Evaluate the autoloads for the package to make it
  available to the user.
- Load.  Actually load the package and run some code from it.
