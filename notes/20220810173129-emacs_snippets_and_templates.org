#+filetags: :Stream:

* Introduction
Continue the topic about in-buffer completion, but from a slightly
different angle.

* abbrev
Very simple templates.

- global/mode
- ~list-abbrevs~

Expansion:
- abbrev-mode
- ~C-x '~
- ~cape-abbrev~

* dabbrev
Auto-generated prefix-based abbrevs.
- ~dabbrev-expand~
- ~dabbrev-completion~
- ~cape-dabbrev~

* Snippets
Predefined text templates.

** S-exps vs Plain-text
It's a matter of taste, but also an important implementation detail.

** Expansion
- abbrev
- capf
- tempel-insert

** Application area

* TempEL cons and pros
Pros:
- Simple.
- Based on already existing tempo syntax.
- Integrates nicely with the rest of emacs.
- Easy to contribute.

Cons:
- Less wide-spread.
- Less templates.
- Less tools for snippets conversion.

* Conclusion
- There are 3 more useful in-buffer completion mechanisms.
- There are reason to use other packages than TempEL.
- Make love, not war.
