  office, conferencing, more usual user-oriented.
- https://glesys.com/ :: Sweden-based (1.1EUR/month in 2023).
- https://runbox.com/ :: Norway-based, runs since 2000, 60 days refund
  policy, 2 years for the price of one, support replies are very
  quick, web interface is quite sucky (inconsistent and unintuitive),
  can pay with crypto.
