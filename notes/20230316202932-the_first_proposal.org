#+title: The First Proposal

* What needed
** For Project
First phase:
- Community.
- Attention via functional DevOps.
- Reproducible Emacs distribution.
- Port of Emacs distro to pinephone and raspberry.

Second phase:
- Cross-platform content-addressable distributed storage.
- Ports of CPCADS to Platforms (pinephone for example), to get more attention through the mobile OS trend.
- Import of current code to CPCADS.

** For Team
- Knowledge and skills on Lisp, RDD, TDD.
- On FP.
- On Guix and FPM.

* We can
Prepare team for the Project.
- Setup a team to use Guix, Guile.
- Dog fooding with Guix -> introduction to lisp, taste of fp, fpm + same dev
  environment (easier to share work).
- Find, make and share materials on lisp, Guix and provide support.

Primary courses:
- Theoretical FP 1 (Scheme, quoting, macros) 1 week.
- Guix (Packaging, API, Services mechanism, Features mechanism, part of G-exps)
  1 week.

Additional courses:
- Emacs Development (Basics of elisp, transient, consult, packaging) 1 week.
- Practical FP (RDD, TDD, Structured Side-Effects, Monads, G-exps) 1 week.
- Theoretical FP 2 (lambda calculus, SICP) 1 week.

On consulting:
- Do a consulting and help to solve hard problems, designing architecture,
  managing development and reducing waste.
- Help with Emacs Distro Development.
- Help with preparing patches for Guix/rde/Emacs.

I plan to keep working on those things anyway:
- Develop guile-tree-sitter :: useful for import to CPCADS.
- Develop ~gider~, a scheme dev environment :: useful for guile development, but
  later can be used as dev environment for CPCADS.
- Develop functional DevOps tooling.

* The Value
** Education
avg middle dev salary: 80k euro/y -> 6.6k/m,
4 people learning for one month will cost ~27k/m.

I can teach the same 4 times faster:
1 week course will cost 22k. It saves ~5k euro and 3 weeks of time.

** Consulting
4 full days of consulting for 5k/m.

Think about result-based consulting.

10% cut + discuss other options (help with reloc, housing, equipment, making the
course public, design on website).

* 3 more weeks in Turkey
** Install guix, setup shared emacs config
- Make a guix workshop.
- Prepare a repo with shared config.
- Make a shared config workshop (escape hatch?).
- Prepare a repo with [[id:4dadff86-15a1-4048-90ef-68c8b70b7bd9][PinePhone Pro]] config.
- Make a ppp image build workshop.

** Write a course outline and prepare a contract
- See how workshops go.
- Make and discuss the outline.
- Discuss other tasks (to make an estimate work).

** Learn Istanbul
- Rent a room for 5 days.
- Perform a research on ikamet or other stuff.
