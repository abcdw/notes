** Introduction
Hello and welcome everyone.  I'm Andrew Tropin, you may know me for rde and Guix Home projects or some other way.  I solve problems and explore the world and usually it involves FOSS.

** Initial Setup
- REPL.
- gider and test functions.

** Tasks
- [X] Fix xfail test.
- [ ] Commit nginx test.
- [ ] Draft nginx-service-type.

** Notes
- We don't have a function to run a particular test.
- Rerun failed tests doesn't care about direct test function invocation. (when we call a function explicitly using eval last exp or similiar).
- Rerun failed tests doesn't care about xfail.

** Conclusion
- Short feedback loop make the process enjoyable.
- Tools for guile involves.
- TDD allows to offload the big picture to tests, and focus on very specific
  part.
