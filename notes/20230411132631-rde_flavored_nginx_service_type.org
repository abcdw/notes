#+filetags: :Stream:

* Introduction
I solve interesting problems and do a lot of FOSS development along
the way, you may know me as an author of Guix Home and rde projects or
maybe for something else.

* Tasks
- Explain why we need a separate implementation.
- Make an nginx-service-type.

* FOSS Business Updates
- Contract on Guix/rde based Dev Environment and Education.
- Possible projects.
- More updates will be on [[https://fosstodon.org/@abcdw][fosstodon.org/@abcdw]].

* Conclusion
- I can keep working on rde and Guix.
- I can finally start program my infrastructure in Scheme.
- Hope you will find this work useful for educational and practical
  purposes.
