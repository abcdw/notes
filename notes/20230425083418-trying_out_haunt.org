* Introduction
Have you ever thought how to manage your own web page or blog?

There are a plenty of options from SSG to full-fledged CMS and blog
engines and today we will cover one of them


I'm Andrew Tropin, I solve interesting problems and do a lot of FOSS
development along the way, you may know me as an author of Guix Home
and rde projects or maybe for something else.

* Why SSG?
Prevents repetition and makes it content first.

* Why Haunt?
Minimalistic, hackable, written in Scheme.

* What to Try
- Build a minimal blog.
- A few pages + 2 blogs.
- Shared css and header/menu.
- Rebuild on change.
- Using without CLI.
- Building a guix package.

* Conclusion
- It's indeed minimalistic and hackable, and anyone can study it in a
  reasonable amount of time, modify or throw out parts they want or
  doesn't need easily.
- Try out haunt yourself.
