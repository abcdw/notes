#+title: OCaml Programming: Correct + Efficient + Beautiful

A book and video series on [[id:dddfbe59-d032-46db-8a0a-239b41fee3c2][OCaml]].

Topics covered:
- Types.
- Functional Programming.
- Data Structures (Functional and Imperative).
- Improving corectness methods (from pair programming to formal verification).
- Testing (TDD, Black/Glass box).
- Hash Tables, Hashing.
- Amorthized analyzis.
- Binary-Search Trees (BSTs), functional version of Balancend BSTs.
- Building an interpreter, small and big step evaluation.
- Semantics of the languages.
- Computational Model, substitution and environments.
- Dynamic and Lixical scopes.
- Type Checker, Static Environment, Type Inference.

New to me:
- 2-3 Trees.
- Type inference algorithm.
- Types are just logic propositions.

Chapter 6 Video 20 Debugging tells to follow a scientific method:
- Formulate falsifiable hypothesis.
- Create an experiment that can refute that hypothesis (find a
  smallest possible input to cause fault).
- Run the experiment.
- Make a note in lab notebook.
