#+title: DnD Ideas

* Cursed Paladin with Tourret Syndrome
The witch cursed you and now you always lies. In addition to that for
every interaction you roll d6 and if 1 pick most offensive
reply/action.

* Rogue Party
2-4 rouges (maybe multiclassed) trying to sneak through all places,
splinter cell way to the win.
