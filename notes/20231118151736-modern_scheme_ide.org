#+title: Modern Scheme IDE - BobKonf 2023

Format: 40 minutes talk + 5 minutes Q&A.  English.
* Proposal
** Abstract
The emergence of new IDEs, particularly those open to inspection,
study, and modification, is a rarity in today's landscape. However,
the need for enhanced development tools within the Guile Scheme
ecosystem prompted the initiation of the guile-ares-rs project. To
document and share the experiences of designing and developing an IDE,
this talk has been prepared.

The talk will provide a brief introduction to interactive and
REPL-driven development workflows, a deep dive into IDE architecture,
including its design rationale and key technical details. This
exploration is intended to enhance the understanding of functional
programming patterns and language constructions (like delimited
continuations) through the examination of real-world examples of their
application.

Main topics covered are:
- Client-server architecture, nREPL protocol and extensibility.
- Concurrency and parallelism through Fibers ([[id:aee3e3f5-a06d-442b-b7ce-26eec99215df][Parallel Concurrent ML]]
  paper implementation for Guile).
- Reusable Threads and interruptible evaluation via delimited
  continuations.

By sharing this journey, the talk aims to encourage community
collaboration and knowledge sharing, fostering the growth and
evolution of development tools in the Guile, Scheme, Lisp and FP
ecosystems.  Itâ€™s an invitation to join a conversation about advancing
software development tooling and workflows.

** Contributions
This talk will provide:
- A better understanding and practical application of functional
  programming patterns, tools and ideas.
- A deeper understanding of development tooling, its capabilities,
  areas of application and possible workflows.
- A good source of information for development of client part for
  other text editors like vim, vscode, sublime, etc.
- A foundation for future development of extensions and tools for
  server side part.

** Bio
I'm Andrew Tropin, I work on operating systems and programming
languages and do a lot of Free and Open Source Software Development.
