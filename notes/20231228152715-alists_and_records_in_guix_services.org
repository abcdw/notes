#+title: Alists and Records in Guix Services

Compound note on related discussions:
- [[https://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/guix-devel/2023-12/msg00217.html][Are declarative app configs worth it?]] :: a thread questioning the
  duplication of all options in guix service and lack of escape
  hatches.
- [[https://yhetil.org/87ild88kax.fsf@trop.in][Free Style Nginx Service Type]] :: example implementation of free
  style alist and vector based configuration for nginx, which can
  express arbitrary nginx configuration without any restrictions.
  Zero replies.
- [[https://yhetil.org/87r0nwh5om.fsf@trop.in][Sharing service code between Home and System]] :: a problematic patch,
  which introduces state and unecessary DSL to bypass restrictions of
  current service implementation approach.
- [[https://yhetil.org/87h7b2b6n3.fsf@trop.in][[RFC PATCH] doc: Add Writing Service Configuration section.]] :: A
  proposal/style-guide for guix service implementation approach.  It
  was intended for making a foundation, which can help to standartize,
  unify and improve service configurations.  No attention from guix
  core team.
- [[https://yhetil.org/87ily7hm4x.fsf@trop.in][[bug#50967] file-like objects instead of gexps]], [[https://yhetil.org/878rvp1deg.fsf@trop.in][Return back original implementation for text-config serialization]] :: a
  little one-way discussions on implementation of guix services
  configuration and its problems.
- [[https://fosstodon.org/@civodul@toot.aquilenet.fr/110213455806505015][Message by Ludovic Courtes]] :: Neat! Iâ€™ve been frustrated by the
  nginx service, I agree we can do better:
