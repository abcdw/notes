#+title: Proposal for incognet.io on Guix Base Image

#+begin_src markdown
Hello my dear incognet hackers!

TLDR: Let's cooperate and make a guix base image for incognet.

I'm Andrew Tropin, FOSS developer, one of Guix
[committers](https://savannah.gnu.org/project/memberlist.php?group=guix). I
work on operating systems and programming languages and
[do](https://trop.in/does) consulting on reproducible development
environments.

I use your service for a couple years now and very happy with it. My
VPS have a guix on it, and there are two options how to get it: via
custom ISO or "infection" of Debian and both of them are quite
involved. There is a demand for guix-ready VPSes in guix community and
from my business customers (I do consulting for).

If we could provide a guix base image, which is easy to spin up from
control panel or API, I would be really happy to recommend incognet
for guix hosting. Also, I have a youtube
[channel](https://yewtu.be/@abcdw) and mastodon
[account](https://fosstodon.org/@abcdw) with around 2-3k of very
tech-savvy followers, and some of them will be interested in it too.

I would be really happy to collaborate both in terms of implementation
and marketing of the results. LMKWYT!
