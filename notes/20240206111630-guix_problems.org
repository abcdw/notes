#+title: Guix Problems

Notes for myself, not intended for external reader without context,
but if you want to understand more underlying issues, just ask.

* ~guix pull~ is not reproducible
guix pull from the same channel definition with specific commits
produces different profiles hashes on different machines.
https://issues.guix.gnu.org/69284

* Services are drafty, untested and inflexible
You can't add rtmp section to nginx.  directory-service don't export
backend-userroot-configuration, create-suffix-entry? breaks the
config.
https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/guix.git/tree/gnu/services/ldap.scm?h=0beb0dbfe0#n136

Records doesn't provide "compile-time guarantees" and doesn't allow
to implement arbitrary config at the same time.
