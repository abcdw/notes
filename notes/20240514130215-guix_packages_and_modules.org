#+title: Guix Packages and Modules Porblems

Guix packages being defined as a variables in modules is problematic.

Hard to troubleshoot cyclic module dependencies.

Not possible to use a few versions of the same channel.
[[id:35590bef-219c-4391-bf43-6c70d7b7e90d][Guix Channels are not Flakes]]

Hard to programmatically transform: packages are not functions
depending only on their inputs as in nix, but a mutable language
objects, which can reference everything from any location.

Package definitions can be impure (depend on values of environment
variables, do some random stuff, etc).
