#+title: JBrowse Guile Hoot Integration

* Integration between JBrowse and Hoot
https://jbrowse.org/jb2/
We need to display data generated by guile code in JBrowse.

* Hoot Bootstrap

* Interactive Development
Is not possible to have a proper interactive development at the
moment.  Due to lack of eval:
https://gitlab.com/spritely/guile-hoot/-/issues/265

It's possible to reload ABI compatible binaries using load_extension:
https://spritely.institute/files/docs/guile-hoot/0.4.1/JavaScript-API-reference.html

With ~(hoot reflection)~ it's possible interpret hoot code in guile's
REPl.

Call Scheme from js:

* TODO JBrowse integration
- Find reference rat genome. https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/downloads.html#mouse
- Deploy JBrowse with it and upload reference genome.
- Add simple track.
- Plot the SNPs to the track.

* GWAS Plotter
python implementation of
https://github.com/cel7t/plotter

* Considerations
- JS can be slow comparing to WASM.
