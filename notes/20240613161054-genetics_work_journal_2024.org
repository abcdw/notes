Setting up dev environment for spinning up jbrowse following
[[https://jbrowse.org/jb2/docs/quickstart_web/][jb2-quickstart-guide]].  Downloading mm39 mouse genome from [[https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/mm39/bigZips/][ucsc.edu]].
Creating FASTA Index with samtools.  Wrapping all the steps into
Makefile with guix environment providing all necessary tools.

Looking around for plugins example and read API documentation.  Trying
to build gwas [[https://github.com/cmdcolin/jbrowse-plugin-gwas][plugin]], having troubles with pangocairo and pkg-config.
pango provided by guix exposes pangocairo2.pc, to get pangocairo.pc we
need pango@1.50.14.  Having troubles with tsdx, preset-env,
@babel/core, caniuse-lite.

The best result I could get so far:

#+end_src

Such experinces drains my soul.  Abandoned the mission, trying to
setup a sample plugin.  Fighting troubles with rollup dependency.
Removed ~"@jbrowse/development-tools": "^2.1.1"~.  Returned it back, did
~npm install --force~.  Added pluign to previously created jbrowse
installation.

Looking for snps data: Snps data for mm10:
https://github.com/cel7t/plotter/blob/master/data.csv

Uploading mm10.
https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/mm10/bigZips/

Trying to load hoot js-runtime via plugin.  Maintaining separate
jbrowse and jbrowse plugin repo is cumbersome, combining them into
one.  Trying to export Scheme class to plugin.  Workarounded it by
loading runtime-js into index.html of JBrowse itself.

* W26
Trying to set up an empty JBrowse track under reference genome track.
Added a GWA track based on the react views from
https://github.com/cmdcolin/jbrowse-plugin-gwas source code.

Trying to plot a dot on the track.  Let's try to plot the whole
dataset first:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cel7t/plotter/master/data.csv Trying
transform data.csv to bed format.  Wrote a simple python script
csv2bed.py, created tbi index with tabix. Try to plot it: no features
are available for Renderer.

The feature are not available, because there is no alias information
provided to adapter, probably adding this one should fix it:
https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/mm10/bigZips/mm10.chromAlias.txt

Yeees, it's.  I got the dots plotted and typescript callback for
rendering triggered.

* W27
We got GWAS track rendered, and features available in renderer
callback, now let's try to send them into hoot code, which will just
print it to console.  Hm, calling a hoot function from js is not
obvious, can find any examples and docs.  Probably need to obtain an
object from Scheme.load_main and somehow interact with it. Exploring
reflect.js for related functionality.  Ok, you can make the hoot
module to return a function.

#+begin_src javascript
// hello.wasm should have a procedure as the last top-level form
[tmp] = await Scheme.load_main("hello.wasm", {}, {
    window: { alert: (s) => window.alert(s)}});
tmp.call()

// if we return a list of functions, we can call a particular one with
tmp.reflector.car(tmp).call()
#+end_src

We need to load wasm module from inside plugin to obtain the value we
can use for accessing hoot functions.  Trying to import reflection.js
from index.ts.

10h.

* W28
Learning about TypeScript module system.  Installed lsp server, now
it's easier to navigate through the project and see ts errors.  Fuck,
everything is broken and plugin don't work now.  Ok, it's comming from
~"module": "commonjs"~, removing it fixes the issue.

22 import MyClass from './src/MyClass';

ok, it should have been ~./MyClass~, not ~./src/MyClass~.

I've reset all the settings and changes and now I get in js console:

#+begin_src text
TypeError: Services.prefs is undefined
#+end_src

WTF?  Clearing all the storage solved the problem.

Class with static method works fine. Moving dummy class into subfolder. Works good.

Renamed class to TmpClass and downcased filename, trying the following import:

#+begin_src text
import OClass from './test-subfolder/myclass';
#+end_src

and it works, WTF?


Trying to move the code of dummy class into js-runitme/reflect.js.

We got back to already encountered error:
#+begin_src text

#+end_src

The funny thing that the line 1335 doesn't exist in reflect.js.  It's
only 718 lines in this file.  Let's do a binary search by commenting
out parts of reflect.js.  The problem is in SchemeModule class.  More
preciesly with BigInts.

Tried to add babel "plugins": ["@babel/plugin-syntax-bigint"], didn't work :/

It seems the problem is in acorn js parser used by rollup, which is
5.something, which doesn't support bigints literals.

@jbrowse/development-tools requires "rollup-plugin-node-globals",
which is 6 years old and depends on acorn 5.7.2.

Overrided transitive dependency, but it doesn't seem to help.

There is a hardcoded ecmaVersion in rollup-plugin-node-globals:
https://github.com/calvinmetcalf/rollup-plugin-node-globals/blob/edbbbbd7c485452a0168b27caa5ad49e58cf3cfe/src/inject/index.js#L59

I hardcoded the fix in this line.

Trying to make hoot reflector accessible to draw function.  The problem
is that load_main is asyncronous, draw is syncronous.

Plugin loading is syncronous.
Top-level await is not supported, cause of module type.

Asked how to deal with it in jbrowse matrix chat.

Reporting acorn problem.  There is alternative plugin template here,
which doesn't use rollup:
https://github.com/GMOD/jbrowse-plugin-protein3d/tree/master

Adding async keyword to the implementation of the interface made a difference (now I can use await inside draw).
https://git.sr.ht/~abcdw/jbrowse-plugin-hoot-gwas/commit/07e2ecf#src/LinearManhattanRenderer/LinearManhattanRenderer.ts-2-4

Moreover, I can call wasm functions and it works:
https://git.sr.ht/~abcdw/jbrowse-plugin-hoot-gwas/commit/07e2ecf#src/LinearManhattanRenderer/LinearManhattanRenderer.ts-3-10

However, I can't obtain value from the call to wasm function, at least following console.log doesn't print anything:
https://git.sr.ht/~abcdw/jbrowse-plugin-hoot-gwas/commit/07e2ecf#src/LinearManhattanRenderer/LinearManhattanRenderer.ts-3-6

Succeed to path the value from hoot to js, however passing objects and
functions is still problematic, I can't pass the lambda from js to
hoot.

When I change parameter type for console log from (ref string) to (ref
eq) it stops printing anything.  WHy?

Trying to get property of js object.
#+begin_quote

Trying to implement this function the following way:
#+begin_src javascript

      getProperty: (o, key) => Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(o, key).value,
    },
#+end_src

Trying to pass js random generator to Scheme code, with some amount of type adjustments it started to work.

* W31
Implementing draw-feature in hoot.  Going good.

Found how to display all chromosomes at once.  In what order they
should go?  You can order chromosomes through mm10.fa.fai.

Oouch, type conversion during the interop is quite involved, it forces
to write a lot of boilerplate.

#+begin_quote
This week was quite productive:
- Found the way to render all chromosomes.
- Rewrote rendering logic of single SNP to Hoot.

 https://git.sr.ht/~abcdw/jbrowse-plugin-hoot-gwas/tree/09b50e9/scheme/hoot/hello.scm#L102
Screenshot in the attachment.

Passing capabilities is quite painful, because in FFI you can't have
polymorphic function (both by type and number of arguments).  Also, all
values except strings and numerics are opaque, so it's usually tricky to
write the code on the js/hoot border and it necessary to use hacks like
this one (notice call1-f64-f64):

Rewriting iterators into hoot.  How to understand that boolean is
true?  Let's make external->boolean+boolToNull hack.

Holy js consistency. Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(o, key).value
doesn't work for iterator values, what the heck.

Found a problem in get-property types, it fixes the previously
existing problems I had with interop.

Added init make target.  Adding a patch with js parser fix.  Cleaned
up all the targets, added init targets.

Implemented draw-features!  Migrated to it.

Building node with v8 takes more than 2 hours, I interrupted the build
process, because laptop is going very hot and it's probably harmful
for it.

Will try to build it without test and nodejs dependency.  It've been built quite fast, but loading fails with:

#+begin_quote
Uncaught (in promise) LinkError: import object field 'code_source' is not a Function

Maybe I need to build a fresh js-reflection as well.  New hoot has a
different js runtime structure of the directories.

#+begin_quote
I've been working on introducing hoot modules, however faced a number of
issues.  First of all I started simple and created an empty file with
just module definition and one variable exported.  It didn't work, more
details in full journal log.  Asked on spritely irc, didn't get a
response yet, dthompson last seen is August 17, he probably out of
office.

The second attempt was using entry point scheme file as before (without
modules) and add modules to load path, however support for
hoot-load-paths was added after last release.  I decided to update hoot
to latest commit and the fun begin.  I tried a lot of combinations of
dependencies to built it and pass test, it didn't pass vm tests.  I
decided to borrow the definitions for guix scm, but it was building for
almost an hour and I interrupted it and tried to built without tests and
with old node.  After built I tried to compile and run previously
working hoot code, but the execution failed with:

Uncaught (in promise) LinkError: import object field 'code_source' is
not a Function

I decided to fallback to the option with updated node version, but after
building for 2.5 hours on 16 threads I stopped the process, because it
can be harmful for the laptop and makes it unusable during the build
time.

I went back to the previous option with old node and without tests and
tried to update reflect.js and js-runtime from newly built package,
however it didn't help.
