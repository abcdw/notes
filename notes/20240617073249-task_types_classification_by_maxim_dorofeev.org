#+title: Task Types Classification by Maxim Dorofeev

It's a simple classification, which helps to escape writers
block/procrastination/fear of upcomming uknown amount of work.

- Task :: something you just need to do, without much of mindfulness
  state.
- Project :: not actionable item, requires mindfulness and focus to
  produce 1-2 tasks to proceed in the right direction.
- Idea :: requires a creative state of mind, can produce task, project
  or be discarded.

* Green/Red
There are tasks that are required (red), usually they have deadlines
and failing them leads to negative outcomes.  There are green tasks,
which are nice to do for future yourself, but it's easy to postpone
them, because they are not necessary.

How do you feel after accomplishing/failing:
| type  | not done               | done okeish    | done well  |
|-------+------------------------+----------------+------------|
| Red   | Negative effect / loss | it's fine      | it's fine? |
| Green | it's fine              | Good and Nice! | Wunderbar! |

* Priorities
- A :: have to be done today.
- B :: this week.
- C :: not this week.
