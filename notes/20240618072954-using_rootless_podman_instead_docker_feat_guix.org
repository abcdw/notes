#+title: Rootless Podman instead of Docker on Guix
#+filetags: :Video:

* Introduction
- Environment isolation
- Quick deployment
- Low hardware footprint

To quickly setup needed app consisting of a few services.  Check
something on a different distribution/environment.

* Why not Docker?
- Security
- Simplicity
- Modularity
- Consistency
- Features (pods, compose, kube, etc)

Basically all the functionality of the docker, but a bit cleaner
implementation and organization wise.

* How?
https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/docs/tutorials/rootless_tutorial.md
https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/rootless.md
- Add subuid/subgid.
- Tweak some goodies.

* Testing
- ~podman run --rm alpine ls / -lia~
- ~podman images~
- ~podman ps -a~
- ~podman run -dt -p 8080:80/tcp httpd~
- ~podman stop -l~
- ~pomman rm -l~

* What next?
- Building containers with Guix. (Without Buildah, Container or
  Dockerfiles).
- Using OCI containers for Guix Home/System Services.

* Conclusion
