#+title: Do ares.extension Need to Depend on nrepl.session?

- related :: [[id:15f9ea06-65b4-4898-97e4-199a065e2d9e][nREPL]]

Semantically it doesn't make much sense because extensions are tied to
processing loop and independent from session.  It can even modify
nrepl.session extension, so it probably should not depend on it.

Cause of it ares.bencode (ares.transport) extension have a fallback
for adding id te replies.
