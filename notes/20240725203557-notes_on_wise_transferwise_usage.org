#+title: Notes on Wise (TransferWise) Usage

- It's better to send (SWIFT) money from Wise USD account to BOG EUR
  account, than in BOG USD.

- It seems cheaper (at least for small amounts < 1000) to send money
  directly to BOG USD account from guru.com than transfering them to
  Wise without commision and then sending them to BOG USD
  account. 12.43 USD commission for any amount.

- However, if I want to convert USD to EUR, it's much better to send
  to Wise USD account and then to BOG EUR. 5.11 USD commission for 700 USD.
