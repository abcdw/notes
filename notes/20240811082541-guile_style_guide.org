#+title: Guile Style Guide

We need a centralized place with [[id:e052a190-e23b-4ea2-b8b8-54c272f0b50a][Guile]] language best practices.

Actually, I don't want it to be exactly a style guide, for formatting
code the linter must be used (and created first).

I talk about the way you should structure you code, document and
distribute.

Obvious areas to cover:

- Documentation :: both inline and external/project-wise.
- Project Structure :: directory names, src/scheme, test/hoot, etc.
- Naming Conventions :: from variables to modules and files.
- Primary Libraries :: which SRFIs and libraries to use and which to
  avoid.  What records implementation, testing framework, exceptions.
- Exceptions :: what API to use to define them, how to raise and how
  to handle.
- Tests :: how to write tests, where to place them, how to make
  fixtures, how to run locally and on CI.
