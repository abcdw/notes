#+title: Hygienic Macros in Guile

There are a few difference with Racket macro system and it's better to
know about them, because many papers and tutorials are written for
Racket.

* There is no syntax->list
https://www.greghendershott.com/fear-of-macros/pattern-matching.html

There is no such function as syntax->list, because syntax containing a
few nested syntax is already a proper list in Guile Scheme.  Such
function can be implemented with syntax-case, but as it turned out
it's not needed, you can just directly work with the list :)

* There is no syntax-id-rules
It's called identifier-syntax and uses slightly different syntax. But
it should be relatively easy to implement syntax-id-rules with it.
