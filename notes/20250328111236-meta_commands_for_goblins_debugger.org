* How to filter the ,vat-tail output?
I want to "pipe" the output of vat-tail to fiend only events of a
particular type.

* How to implement programmatic vat-up/vat-down/vat-jump calls?
Probably by "Auto-typing" them into the REPL and checking the output
and prompt.  We have a bit of experience that stdin/stdout integration
is far from great (no async, no concurency, impossible to tell if it
frozen or just WIP, impossible to interrupt, etc).
